            <h4>Choosing a smokeless tobacco product instead of cigarette smoking</h4>
            <p>It is common for tobacco users who wants to quit smoking to switch to using Swedish snus. Opting out of tobacco smoke means harm reduction and reduces the risk of cancer. Swedish snus is also a more comfortable and discreet way to consume nicotine. An enormous number of smokers have also chosen to switch to nicotine pouches and use it as an alternative to cigarettes.</p>
            <p>At SnusMe we believe that this is one of the reasons why nicotine pouches have become so big, and it is therefore believed that this nicotine-free alternative to Swedish snus has been of great benefit to public health. Instead of replacing tobacco smoking with Swedish snus that also contains tobacco, many people appreciate that nicotine pouches are completely free of tobacco. They still add the amount of nicotine that the smoker is used to and also gives a more fresh feeling and eliminates the increased risk that tobacco smoke entails.</p>
            <h4>Continuous research on Swedish snus</h4>
            <p>The use of Swedish snus has been associated with oral cancer. This was built on results from epidemiologic studies on smokeless tobacco products from other countries, which contain other substances compared to Swedish snus. For example the tobacco specific nitrosamines (TSNA) as Swedish snus contains very little of.</p>
            <p>Swedish Match writes about this on their website, and tells about the latest research. Recently, a study was published that examined the mortality of cancer with snus users. The relationship has been evaluated in so-called prospective cohort studies. The study shows show that Swedish snus is not a risk factor for oral cancer, and that mortality from cancer is not increasing among Swedish snus users.</p>
            <h4>History behind Swedish snus</h4>
            <p>At SnusMe, we are interested in the history of snus, which dates back to 1492 when Columbus landed in America. It was the first time that Europeans came in contact with tobacco leaves. They took the tobacco home to Europe in the form of dried and finely grounded tobacco leaves that were sniffed up through the nose, so-called snuff.</p>
            <p>The previous record that tobacco is found in Sweden is from the year 1601. Then the customs in Stockholm noted that tobacco and pipes have been brought into the country. At that time, tobacco began to be grown in Sweden on a large scale. In 1724, the Swedish king Fredrik calls for tobacco cultivation throughout the country, with the goal of making Sweden self-sufficient within four years.</p>
            <p>During the 18th century, snuff was a "must have" among the aristocracy, and up to the 18th century master equipment heard a snus can. It is in the early 19th century that moist snus is added under the lip becomes more popular than snuff, and when the use is now moved from nose to mouth it becomes popular to snus. Today's supply of Swedish snus is perhaps greater than ever, and we hope you will find your favorite here at SnusMe.</p>
